- main.c will work out the CLI
- init.c will listen on appropriate port
- handler.c will read from socket and send it to parser.c
  It will create the request struct and send it to parser.c
- parser.c will build the structs from the parsed http
- handler.c will handle the request and build a response struct
- response.c will respond to the request
  (501 when not-implemented method)

- http_constants.h will hold all http constants
- structs.h


How to create response
***********************
- have a handle_request() function, which can forward to
 handle_get, handle_post, etc.
  - Then, in these functions, you know you are dealing with a
    get/post/etc
- These can build the whole response
- Right after, you can send it to response.c


Questions about http
**********************
How is content other than text handled? char array, but
really is just bytes...
TODO: include an img in index.html (with a real src, and see how
you handle that)

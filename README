- main.c will work out the CLI
- init.c will listen on appropriate port
- parser.c will build the structs from the parsed http
- handler.c will handle the request and build a response struct
- response.c will respond to the request
  (501 when not-implemented method)

- http_constants.h will hold all http constants
- structs.h


How to handle large amounts of incoming data

-> save last line in temp buffer


TODO: Clearly define structs' structure, along with how
large amount of data will be managed.
